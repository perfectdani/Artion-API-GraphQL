Internally it utilizes RPC to access Opera/Lachesis full node for blockchain interaction. Mongo database
for fast, robust and scalable off-chain data storage, especially for aggregated and pre-calculated data mining
results. BigCache for in-memory object storage to speed up loading of frequently accessed entities.
